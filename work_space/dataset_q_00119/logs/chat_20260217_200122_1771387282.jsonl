The monovalent ion K⁺ has log gamma = -0.244, while the divalent ion SO₄²⁻ has log gamma = -1.176. If you compare these values to the log gamma at I = 0.1 M (K⁺: -0.158, SO₄²⁻: -0.414), how much more negative does log gamma become when ionic strength increases 50-fold?\n\na) K⁺ decreases by 0.05, SO₄²⁻ decreases by 0.10 (equal change)  \nb) K⁺ decreases by 0.086, SO₄²⁻ decreases by 0.762 (divalent changes more)  \nc) Both change by exactly the same amount  \nd) K⁺ changes more than SO₄²⁻\n\nSteps:\n1) Use tools as needed for PHREEQC/quantitative work.\n2) Your response should be in the form <<< X >>>, where X is either A, B, C, or D.\n3) Use write_file to create or overwrite final_answer.txt in the current workspace.\n   The file content must be exactly: <<< X >>> followed by a newline.\n"}
